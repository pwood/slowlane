Slowlane - Utility to populate and maintain the MythTV channels tables with 
data extracted from the propriatary Media Highway middleware data.

By Peter Wood <peter+slowlane@alastria.net>

Notes:

This program reimplements small sections of the ETSI EN 300 468 specification
for interpreting Service Information, rather than including libraries such
as libsi. It's aim is to be a light weight program with little external
requirements, unless absolutely required (such as MySQL).

It is specifically aimed at the version of Media Highway as used by BSkyB,
several assumptions and default values may be targetted as such and require
further configuration for other providers.
